# mCT Simulation \& Data
### Contains example data for a Siemens Biograph mCT intended for use by CCP-SyneRBI

_GATE_ folder contains all macros needed to recreate GATE simulation of an <sup>18</sup>F-filled NEMA Image Quality phantom in a Siemens Biograph mCT. This is done with a simulation time of 120 seconds with an activity of around 2.6 kBq/ml in the spheres and 0.5 kBq/ml in the background.

Real data from Siemens Biograph mCT courtesy of Jose Anton-Rodriguez; to be added imminently.
